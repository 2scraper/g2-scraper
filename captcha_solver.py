"""captcha_solver.py — detection + solving policy. Comments may name a site
for context; no site-specific selector or URL lives here. Per-site markers
are passed in by the caller (see BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS in g2_parser.py)
rather than hardcoded, so this module stays reusable across the family.

Policy, matching the family's hard-won rule that "detected != blocking":

  - Detection stays broad — run it on every page, unconditionally.
  - A captcha WIDGET present on a page whose products are already rendered
    guards nothing and is not solved: `--solve-captcha when-blocked` (the
    default) only pays for a solve when `count_product_links(html) == 0`.
  - A missing key or a solver-side error is a WARNING, never a crash — the
    run continues, and only reports EXIT_BLOCKED if the page really was
    gated (see output_writer.EXIT_BLOCKED).

**`count_product_links` is a page-SHAPE-specific callable, and passing the
wrong one is a real, already-shipped-and-fixed bug class** (shein-scraper,
2026-09-22 — see that repo's CHANGELOG and this repo's own `g2_parser.py`
module docstring). It answers "does this page ALREADY have the real
content it is supposed to have, so don't pay for a solve" — which means a
LISTING page must pass a listing-card counter, a product-DETAIL page must
pass a "did the detail parser find real data" counter, and a pricing page
its own counter. A listing-shaped counter used on a detail page returns 0
by construction on every completely normal page load, which turns any
stray generic marker into a false "possibly blocked" read and, when a real
sitekey also happens to be present, into a wasted PAID solve. There is no
safe default here: every call site passes its own.

**DataDome (g2.com's own bot defense — `window.DataDomeJsTag`,
`dd.g2.com/js/`, confirmed live) has no automated solve path at all.**
`GENERIC_BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS` below already carries `"datadome"`, so
DETECTION works out of the box; solving does not, and there is deliberately
no `CaptchaType` member for it (see `identify_unsupported_vendor()` and
`solve_when_blocked()`'s `"unsupported_vendor"` action, restored here from
skyscanner-scraper, which hit the identical situation with PerimeterX).
Naming a vendor that cannot be solved is an honest log line; a CaptchaType
with no 2Captcha task type behind it would be a crash waiting for its first
caller.

No page-execution primitive (page.evaluate / execute_script) crosses this
module's boundary: `build_injection_script()` below only BUILDS a plain
JavaScript source string — driver-agnostic, since it's just text — and the
engine (which already speaks its own driver's dialect) is the one that
actually runs it. That split is the same one `solve_when_blocked()` uses
for detection/solving: this module owns policy and JS-source construction,
never the act of running JS against a real page.

**Until 2026-09-21, no engine in this family actually injected a solved
token back into a locally-launched (non `--cdp-endpoint`) browser at
all** — every engine's own `_maybe_solve_captcha` only logged "solved", a
real gap Roman asked about directly after GeeTest support was added
without it. `build_injection_script()` closes that gap using each widget
type's OWN standard, publicly-documented client-integration convention
(a hidden `g-recaptcha-response` textarea for reCAPTCHA v2, a
`cf-turnstile-response` field for Turnstile, and so on) — **not** anything
confirmed against a real g2.com (or any family site's) actual widget
markup, which has never been captured for ANY type. It is the same
"standard convention, explicitly unconfirmed against this site" honesty
posture `g2_parser.py`'s own best-effort parsers use. reCAPTCHA v3
has no such convention — it's invisible, and the token is typically
consumed the instant the SITE'S OWN JavaScript resolves
`grecaptcha.execute()`'s promise (often straight into an XHR, never read
back off a DOM element) — so `build_injection_script()` returns `None` for
it rather than guess at site-specific code, which this shared module's own
charter says does not belong here. None of this has been exercised against
g2.com, whose only confirmed defense (DataDome) is in the
`identify_unsupported_vendor()` bucket above, not the solvable one.

Over `--cdp-endpoint`, none of this applies: 2Captcha's own
`Captcha.setAutoSolve` CDP domain (see each engine's own
`_enable_scraping_browser_auto_solve`) solves AND injects entirely inside
their infrastructure, for whichever widget types their Scraping Browser
extension recognizes (confirmed live, 2026-09-14: Turnstile, Amazon WAF,
Yandex SmartCaptcha, Lemin — GeeTest was NOT in that confirmed list,
though it may be covered and simply wasn't seen in that one capture).
